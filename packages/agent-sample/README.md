# Stratumn Agent Sample

This project contains a sample [agent](https://github.com/stratumn/indigo-js/tree/master/packages/agent-js)
It can be used to test the Indigo Framework without coding anything yourself.

## Docker images

This project provides two docker images:
* Dockerfile uses the latest dependencies published on npm
* Dockerfile.dev uses the latest code (and can be used to experiment with local code changes)
